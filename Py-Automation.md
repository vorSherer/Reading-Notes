### Python Regular Expressions Tutorial <br>
A long read, covering how to work with the __`re`__ library, deal with __pattern matching__, learn about __greedy and non-greedy__ matching, and more. <br>
This is a very good tutorial that I wish had been used in 301 for the first regex assignment - it explains things well enough for cheat sheets to be usable. Also discussed are __Wild Card__ and __Special Characters__, __Grouping__, __Greedy__ vs. __Non-Greedy__ Matching, regex __functions__ and __Compilation Flags__. <br>

### shutil <br>
A moderately long read describing what is and how to use the shutil module. <br>
The __`shutil`__ module includes high-level file operations such as copying and archiving. <br>
This reading describes examples of __copying portions of or complete files__, copying not only the file contents, but also ways of __including metadata__ from the source file, including __permissions__, etc. It can also be used to manipulate __directory trees__, __find files__, and for __creating or extracting archives__. <br>

### Video: Automation Ideas <br>
A brief video suggesting four sample projects to automate common tasks using python; __Automate moving files__ (from one directory to another, using watchdog), __Automatically move and rename files__ (expands the first program), __Open YouTube when favorite YouTuber uploads new video__ (uses selenium, with suggestions for other uses), and __calculate compounding interest__.

### Optional: Automating Your Browser and Desktop Apps <br>
Al Sweigart's 42 minute presentation at PyBay 2016, hyping his then-new book '__*Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*__', and discussing using __Selenium__ for web automation and __pyautogui__ for *GUI Automation*, with demo examples of each. <br>

### Watchdog <br>
__*"A cross-platform Python API library and shell utilities to monitor file system events."*__ This library is used in some examples shown in the Automation Ideas video. <br>
