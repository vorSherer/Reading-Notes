### Data Science in a Nutshell
This was a quick read, describing a high overview of what comprises Data Science. It defines structured and unstructured data, outlines data visualization, and the steps that come next; Data Analysis (by humans), Machine Learning (wherein machines learn to identify patterns in data), and Artificial Intelligence (wherein machines learn data patterns and then make decisions based upon that learning). <br>

### What is Jupyter Lab (incl. video)
The homepage introduces JupyterLab, with an overview descriptive text chock full of outlinks (including one to it's predecessor, Jupyter Notebooks, hosting a number of instructive YouTube videos on their use). The embedded YouTube video summarizes some of the features and how to use them, including a rundown of convenient keyboard shortcuts. <br>

"NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed." <br>

### Numpy Tutorial
This is a fairly simple, yet comprehensive tutorial on how to get started using Numpy, and included a link to a cheat sheet at the bottom (see above). <br>

---
### Numpy Arrays <br>
This multi-page tutorial explains the basics of NumPy in more detail, such as its architecture and environment and the various array functions, types of indexing, etc. <br>
An introduction to Matplotlib is also provided. <br>
