### Whiteboard Advice <br>
<br>
The key to successful whiteboard interviewing is communication - before as well as during the interview. <br>
Before the interview is scheduled, ask the H.R. person for any tips to help you prepare - they may offer little or much information about what to expect.  Any information is a bonus. <br>

For the interview itself, follow this communication strategy: <br>
- __Re-state__ or __paraphrase__ the __*PROBLEM DOMAIN*__ and *ask for confirmation* that you have correct understanding. <br>
- __Ask about Edge Cases__ - Ask how the interviewer would like them handled - what desired output. "In case __*x*__, what should my function do?"<br>
- __Develop your Algorithm__ (logical steps for solving the problem). Add the steps as __*comments*__ that describe what you need to do, in the proper sequence. When finished, __ask if the pseudocode makes sense to the interviewer__. <br>
- __If stuck, ask for help__ - If you get stuck, you *should* be allowed to ask for suggestions / hints.  Ask conversationally, "I'm a little stuck here. Do you have any tips to offer?"
- __Code the solution__ in the language requested. Once finished, __ask again whether your code looks good.__ <br>

### 6 tips to ace a programming interview <br>
<br>
Advice from this writer: <br>
1. __Take a moment to think__. Ask the interviewer for a moment to think through the PROBLEM DOMAIN, think it through, and ask clarifying questions as you go. <br>
1. __Write out your Algorithm__. Write out the logical steps to one side, out of the way. List each step and what it needs to do / how it needs to do it. <br>
1. __Develop your solution in Pseudocode__. This frees one from the actual syntax requirements as one confirms the Algorithm in a code-like language. The key point here is to verify the logic. <br>
1. __Don't sweat the small stuff__. If you make a mistake or forget something, brush it off! If you can't recall something, __*state that you would look it up*__. <br>
1. __Sit down. Be Humble.__ This is as much about __*HOW*__ you work as about *WHETHER YOU SOLVE* the problem. If offered constructive criticism, accept it gracefully. You're demonstrating team fit in doing so. <br>
1. __Come prepared.__ Put in the time necessary to maximize your chances to pass. There is no substitute for putting in solid time and effort beforehand. __RECOMMENDED EFFORT: *Cracking the Coding Interview*__ - Gayle Laakmann McDowell. <br>
1. __Review your finished work.__ Is it __complete and correct?__  Is it __algorithmically efficient__ (i.e., the optimal way to solve the problem)? Walk through a test input or two to check. Test an edge case or two. <br>

A 26 min. HackerRank Radio interview (audio only) featuring opinions from the author of __*Cracking the Coding Interview*__. <br>

- __Don't be a jerk.__
- __Problem-solving skill__ and __intelligence__ are key traits desired in a good hire. <br>
- Interview problems are designed to be hard, __to test the candidate's problem-solving *approach*__ (more than their success). <br>

Facebook uses interviewer training to teach interviewers what to look for and how. <br>

__*"Spend a couple of weeks preparing; doing a solid amount of interviewing prep each week. Don't spend month-to-month doing it. That's crazy."*__ <br>
__* - Know your basic Data Structures and Algorithms really well.*__ <br>
__* - Don't feel insecure, don't lack confidence. It's better to be comfortable with the basics than to be "*pretty* comfortable with a lot of things, up to advanced algorithms."*__ <br>
__* - Push yourself with harder problems.*__ <br>
__The goal (for the candidate) is to get comfortable solving difficult problems.__ <br>
