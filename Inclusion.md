### Diversity and Inclusion <br>

Personally, I have always enjoyed working in a diverse team. We just have had fun working together!
On a more practical level, overlooking simple perspectives such as was mentioned in one article where right-hand-dominant designers completely missed taking left-hand-dominant users into consideration, leading to serious design gaffs was hilarious in the moment, but sadly, all too common. <br>
On a socio-political level, all the above resources describe a thriving industry dominated by white males. One of today's reading sources suggests historical reasons for this and why it persists, another describes potential benefits of including ethnic demographics reflective of target markets. Opinions on the topic are widespread, tend to be America-centric, and biased by cultural mores, but that doesn't negate the fact that offering opportunity to any and all in Tech fields, as with any other, is still good business.  Just keep in mind that it isn't a zero-sum game. Some folks (of any gender, age, ethnicity, etc.) are just not interested. For those that are, opening up opportunities for exploration, education and employment in the field is a great idea. However, recognize that the interest levels of individuals don't neatly conform to their demographic percentage (i.e., just because a particular city population is 17% Latino does not correlate to 17% of that city's population who are Latino being interested in pursuing a particular industry). The key is for there to be opportunity, not quotas. <br>
For me, I just like people.  I enjoy building camaraderie and team spirit and enjoying working together. But until I get into the decision-making levels, this is an academic exercise for me. <br>
Let's make room at the table for everyone, including white males like me! Let's mind our manners at the table so we don't "get sent to our room." <br>
