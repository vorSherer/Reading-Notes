Reading 1 - The first readings centered around CSS - Floats and how they work (and how 'last decade' they are, now replaced largely by Grid and Flexbox, q.v.), and finished up with an ebook called Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS ("SMACSS").

In the words of the author, Jonathan Snook, SMACSS describes, "...how to structure your CSS to allow for flexibility and maintainability as your project and your team grows. SMACSS (pronounced “smacks”) is more style guide than rigid framework."

In the book the author describes his recommendations for rules in grouping CSS commands into compartmentalized files rather than one monolithic file, with a goal of making the code more easily maintainable. 
The author recommends grouping the CSS into the following files; 
Base.css
Layout.css
Modules.css
State.css
Themes.css
He suggests naming conventions that point from class and id tags in the HTML to the CSS file that targets them.
