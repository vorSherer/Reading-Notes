### Using EJS Partials
__Partials__ are a native feature of EJS. *The typical use case* for partials is to hold any reuseable, static (i.e., non-changing) code, such as a common nav bar or footer. You define that reusable code in a file and include it wherever you need it. <br>
A typical path to the partial files would be __views/partials/__(files go here). A nav bar partial might be called __navbar.ejs__, a footer __footer.ejs__, and so on. <br>
Syntax for a partial can be as simple as <br>
__<%- include('relativePath/fileName') %>__ <br>
The __<%- %>__ tags allow us to output the unescaped content onto the page (notice the __-__). This is important when using the __*include()*__ statement since you donâ€™t want EJS to escape your HTML characters.
Simply add this include statement where ever you want the code to appear. <br>
This also simplifies maintaining your code, as any changes get made once in the source file, rather than on every page where it appears!
