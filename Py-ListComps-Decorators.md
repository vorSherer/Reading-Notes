### List Comprehensions <br>
The basic syntax for a "__*List comprehension*__" is __[ *expression* for *item* in *list* if *conditional* ]__. The list comprehension always returns a new result list.<br>


### Primer on Python Decorators <br>
__Decorators__ provide a simple syntax for calling *higher-order functions*. By definition, a decorator is *"a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it."* <br>
In Python, functions are *first-class* objects. This means that functions can be passed around and used as arguments, just like any other object. 

### Debugging with PySnooper <br>
This was a very commercial-ridden, dry presentation on PySnooper *(skip the first 2 minutes)*. The podcast host sounds very scripted and somewhat robotic. The guest was much more personable. One needs to listen to the whole 45 minute talk to pull out about half of that as useful content. PySnooper discussion begins about 6 minutes in.
