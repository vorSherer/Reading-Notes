__Handlebars__ is a templating language based on __*Moustache*__. It enable one to setup template placeholders on an HTML page and pull, filter, compile, and set content from JavaScript, using the Handlebars protocols.

__Flexbox__ is a cleaner, simpler way to control content positioning using CSS.
__Flexbox Froggy__ was an online tutorial "game" to reinforce understanding of how to implement flex commands. I completed all 24 levels.
