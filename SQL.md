### SQL
__SQL__ (commonly pronounced *"Sequel"*) stands for __*Structured Query Language*__. It is a standardized language used to access and alter data stored in __*relational databases*__. There are customized variants that add functionality and libraries that make advanced searches (like full-text searches) much less burdensome, but SQL describes the portion common to most or all of the others - a sort of "middle ground" where all of the commands should work in an expected fashion no matter which of the variants one may be using.
A __database__ is a collection of information organized into __tables__, each of which - like a spreadsheet - is organized into a set number of __columns__ ("fields") and an indefinite number of __rows__ ("records").
A __relational database__ enables one to associate - or "relate" - tables to one another, such that from any one table additional information stored in one or more other tables may be indicated using __*"foreign keys"*__ in the starting table. 
A database is checked for target data using a __"query"__ - or search string - composed using the SQL syntax rules to target, return and/or modify the desired data from the desired tables within the database.
