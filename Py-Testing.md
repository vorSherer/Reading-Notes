### Python Modules and Packages <br>
Modules break monolithic code into separate, smaller, more manageable subtasks or modules that are easier to craft and maintain. <br>

### Pytest Documentation <br>
Pytest is a framework for writing small-but-scalable testing for applications and libraries. Detailed documentation may be found at https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html#toc <br>

### PyTest Tutorial Up to section: Running tests in parallel <br>
This link provides a simple, easy-to-follow tutorial for installing and using pytest. Pytest includes the capability to run tests in parallel, using a user-specified number of 'workers.' <br>
"Fixtures are used when we want to run some code before every test method. So instead of repeating the same code in every test, we define fixtures. Usually, fixtures are used to initialize database connections, pass the base , etc.... To use the same fixture against multiple test files, we will create fixture methods in a file called conftest.py. Pytest will look for the fixture in the test file first and if not found it will look in the conftest.py" <br>

### Recursion <br>
A function may be termed iterative or recursive. When a function calls itself directly or indirectly, it is called 'recursive.' If a function calls itself directly, it is called 'directly recursive.' If a function instead calls another function that, directly or indirectly, calls the first function again, the first function is called 'indirectly recursive.' <br>
In the recursive program, the solution to the base case is provided and the solution of the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems. The idea is to represent a problem in terms of one or more smaller problems, and add one or more base conditions that stop the recursion. If the base case is not reached or not defined, then the stack overflow problem may arise. <br>
A recursive function is tail recursive when recursive call is the last thing executed by the function. <br>

This is actually a video that is available at the beginning of the first reading article. It is an audio readout of most of that article, though the article includes details and graphics that aid in the explanations. <br>
