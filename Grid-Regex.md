# Read 04 - Responsive Web Design and Regular Expressions

#### 2020-03-13

## Responsive Web Design using CSS Grid, and introduction to Regular Expressions (Regex).

__*Grid*__ is an expansion on the capabilities of __Flex__, offering many more ways of positioning content *in a 2D environment* - permitting the user to combine units when specifiying parameters; units in __%__, __px__, __em__, __fr__ etc. may be combined to define an area or target a location.
__*Grid Garden*__ is a tutorial game, much like __*Flexbox Froggy*__, that aids one in practicing using __Grid__ and beginning to think out how Grid targets and manipulates elements in the grid layout.

__*Regular Expressions (regex)*__ is a powerful tool for locating (and manipulating) patterns in text. One can define a pattern one is searching for using the regex syntax, for instance, looking for a number followed by whitespace followed by a capital letter as an indicator of a street address.

Both are powerful tools that take some getting used to, and worth the effort.
