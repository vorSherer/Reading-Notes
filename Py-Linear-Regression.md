### How to Run Linear Regression in Python <br>
A long read that provides a "How to" example of using __scikit-learn__ to model the __*Boston Housing*__ dataset to predict housing prices. <br>

### Linear Regression in Python <br>
A very approachable explanation of regression, its purpose, and how to implement it in python. Still a rather long read. <br>
The regression discussion still goes straight into statistical calculations but returns to approachability when the discussion turns to implementing __NumPy__ and __scikit-learn__ to the problems. The article finishes up with an implementation example of __statmodels__ for advanced Linear Regression modelling. <br>

### Train & Test Splits <br>
A long read that describes "How To" use __Pandas, scikit-learn__ and __matplotlib__ to setup a __*train/test split and cross-vslidation*__ process on regression models. <br>
The two validation methods described in the article are the __K-Folds Cross Validation__ and the __Leave One Out Cross Validation (LOOCV)__ methods. <br>

### What is Linear Regression <br>
A short read, but gets technical quickly. <br>
*"The overall idea of linear regression is to examine two things: __(1)__ does a set of predictor variables do a good job in predicting an outcome (dependent) variable?  __(2)__ Which variables in particular are significant predictors of the outcome variable, and in what way do they–indicated by the magnitude and sign of the beta estimates–impact the outcome variable?" <br>
"Three major uses for regression analysis are __(1)__ determining the __strength of predictors__, __(2) forecasting an effect__, and __(3) trend forecasting__."* <br>
__Types of Linear Regression__ <br>
- __*Simple linear regression*__ <br>
	- 1 dependent variable (interval or ratio), 1 independent variable (interval or ratio or dichotomous)

- __*Multiple linear regression*__ <br>
	- 1 dependent variable (interval or ratio) , 2+ independent variables (interval or ratio or dichotomous)

- __*Logistic regression*__ <br>
	- 1 dependent variable (dichotomous), 2+ independent variable(s) (interval or ratio or dichotomous)

- __*Ordinal regression*__ <br>
	- 1 dependent variable (ordinal), 1+ independent variable(s) (nominal or dichotomous)

- __*Multinomial regression*__ <br>
	- 1 dependent variable (nominal), 1+ independent variable(s) (interval or ratio or dichotomous)

- __*Discriminant analysis*__ <br>
	- 1 dependent variable (nominal), 1+ independent variable(s) (interval or ratio)
