### Linked Lists <br>
The first resource is a handy Code Fellows "one-pager" that contains the highlights of linked lists - what they are and key terminology. *Keep a copy in a safe place!* <br>

### What’s a Linked List, Anyway pt1 <br>
Linked lists are a linear data structure.  There are __singly-linked lists__ that can only be traversed from start-to-end because each node ("link") in the list only knows where the next node is (and no other), or __doubly-linked lists__ which can be traversed back-and-forth because each node knows where the next *AND* previous node are, but the nodes must still be traversed in sequence. There are also __circular linked lists__ which are (either singly- or doubly-)linked lists that have the __*HEAD*__ point to the __*TAIL*__ node, which then points to the first node as it's __'next'__ instead of pointing to a null value.<br>

### What’s a Linked List, Anyway pt2
This article opened with a simplified explanation of __Big O Notation__, then moved to applying it to linked lists and thus described some of the general trade-offs with using them.
