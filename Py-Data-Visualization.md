### Matplotlib Tutorial <br>
Intended as an interactive tutorial, this resource assumes one knows how to implement the installation (which I don't at time of this writing). It does a good job of describing the progressive development of the visualized data, but the strongest benefit comes to those installing the package and "tinkering" with the values to observe effects and explore options. <br>
The tutorial concludes with sample problems to solve, outlinks to further tutorials, and some very handy references. <br>

### Seaborn Tutorial <br>
__Seaborn__ is an alternative to __matplotlib__ and __Pandas__, doing a lot of "heavy lifting under the hood." This link opens a menu-style page of outlinks to various Seaborn tutorials. Content is broken down well, and tutorials organized around how to visualize data and how to do it using seaborn functionality. <br>

### Seaborn Cheat Sheet <br>
A handy reference for those familiar enough with Seaborn to understand the references it contains. <br>

### Bokeh Tutorial <br>
*"__*Bokeh*__ is an interactive visualization library for modern web browsers. Bokeh can help anyone who would like to quickly and easily make interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications."* All with no JavaScript required. <br>
This opens a jupyter notebook containing information on what Bokeh is and how to setup for it, with a menu of links to other notebooks, each representing another tutorial in progressive sequence. <br>
The link to the notebook was unstable as of this writing, dropping out after several minutes on the page. <br>
