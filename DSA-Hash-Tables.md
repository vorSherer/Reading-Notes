##  Intro to Hash Tables <br>
A Code Fellows in-house summary of what hash tables are and a little about how they work and the methods available to access them. <br>

---

## What is a Hash Table? <br>
A short YouTube intro video (part 0 of 11-parts of C++ Hash Table build-out) that again describes the basics of a hash table, with chaining as a collision resolution method. <br>

---

## Basics of Hash Tables <br>
A moderate-length read again describing th efundamentals of hash tables, with illustrations and code snippets (in C#?), and explanations of both chaining, linear probing, quadratic probing and double hashing as collision resolution methods. <br>

---

## Hash Table wiki <br>
A Wikipedia article on Hash Tables. This was the most technical of all of the above resources. Similarly, it is much more thorough in discussing hashin methodology, collision resolution options and dynamic resizing of the array. The article concludes with various performance analyses (with the math). <br>
